# File-Management-and-Retrieval-System
This project is a file management and retrieval system that involves a client-server architecture with load balancing through a mirror server. The client can send various commands to the server to search for files, retrieve files based on size or date, and handle file extensions. The system is designed to handle multiple clients efficiently.
